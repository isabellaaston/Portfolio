					<article>
						<p>I come from a career in Marketing, but decided to make the move into software development as I didn&apos;t feel fulfilled. I am much more suited to the creative problem solving involved in coding, due to its hands on approach. I am really enjoying learning about lots of new technologies, as well as their implementation and look forward to a career full of continuous learning and development.</p>
						<br>
						<p>I thrive in a team, and really get my energy from collaborating with others, and have loved working on projects with my course mates at Mayden Academy.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Having grown up in Spain, I know that the key to a good life is great company and good food, which means that in my spare time, I love spending time in the kitchen, and entertaining friends.</p>
